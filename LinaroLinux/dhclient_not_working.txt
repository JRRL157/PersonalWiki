Scenario:

#dhclient -r eth0 (Worked)
#dhclient -1 eth0 (Not working at all)

What I did?

First, some leases were available on the following file

/var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases

I noticed that the ip was very different from the one that I was trying to push into the client network configuration.

The solution was:

echo "" > /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases
