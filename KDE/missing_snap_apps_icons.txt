Issue: Out of "nowhere", my snap applications icons went missing

What happened: I switched from bash to zsh

Explanation: After switching to zsh, the snap app icons are not loaded properly.

Solution:

Create the file ~/.zprofile and add the following command inside of it:

emulate sh -c 'source /etc/profile.d/apps-bin-path.sh'

Then, logout or restart your machine.
